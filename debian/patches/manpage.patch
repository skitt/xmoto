 is a challenging 2D motocross platform game, where physics plays an important role in the gameplay. You need to control your bike to its limit, if you want to have a chance finishing the more difficult of the challenges.
 
 .SH GAMEPLAY
-A number of strawberries are typically spread around each level, which generally consists of a complicated landscape seen from the side - i.e. much like islands in the sky. You need to collect all those berries to finish the level - when you've got the last one, you need find the sunflower which will complete the level when you touch it. Variations to this basic gameplay may be found around some of the levels.

 Your motocross bike is likewise seen from the side, and you control its throttle, braking, and simple changes to the attitude by jerking the bike back and forth. Additionally you can change the direction of your driving, by rotating on the spot.

If you have the right amount of CPU power, it should even be possible to run X-Moto in OpenGL software emulation mode (MesaGL on linux, Windows' OpenGL fallback driver, etc).
